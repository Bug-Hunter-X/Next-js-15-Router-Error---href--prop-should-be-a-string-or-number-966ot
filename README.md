# Next.js 15 Router Error: "href" prop should be a string or number

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications related to the router's `href` prop.  The error, "Error: Next Router: \"href\" prop should be a string or number," occurs when the `href` prop of a Link component is not provided with a valid string or number.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when the `href` prop of a Next.js Link component is not correctly defined resulting in the error.  The code example shows where this is likely to occur.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking the type and value of the `href` prop passed to the Link component.  The `href` prop should always be a string (representing a valid route path) or a number (in the case of dynamic routes).
